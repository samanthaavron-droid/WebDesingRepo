            <h1>My name is Samantha</h1>
            <p>I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine. It is one of the biggest cities of Europe, and it really shaped me as a person. I really like Kyiv, it's big, it's loud, it's Alive.</p>
            <p>I was always thinking about emigrating to Europe, but I never believed it. Nontheless, currently I live in the little old Amsterdam, and studing for Software Development</p>

            <h1>My House</h1>
            <p>I always lived with my family. My father, mom and brother. Some time ago my grandma used to live with us, but she moved at the same time we did, and it wasn't really the same since.</p>
            <p>Amsterdam gave me a new perspective onto the possibilities of how a home can look.</p>
